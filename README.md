Supplementary Table  1_Survival and Experiment Information: The table shows all experiments identified by the Experiment ID and type of experiment. For each experiment, the drugs used with their respective concentration, how many larvae were treated and how many survived is shown. The survival rate was calculated. Furthermore, it is indicated how many larvae were imaged and the comment column contains information about changes in the standard experimental procedure.
 
 Measurements Morphology Assay: Collection of all results per larva from the morphology assay, measured on the images acquired by automated microscopy.
 
 Measurements Behavior Assay: Collection of all results from the behavior assay per larva, calculated from the tracking data of the swimming recording chamber.
